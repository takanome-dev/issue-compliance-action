This action is meant to help in managing issues. It will check for the following:

- [x] Issue has a title
  - [x] Title starts with a valid issue type (e.g. bug, feature, chore)
  - [x] Title does not contain some characters (e.g. <,>,#)
- [ ] Issue has a description
  - [ ] Description should include all required information based on the issue template
- [ ] Issue has a specific label maybe?

This is a fork of [pr-compliance-action](https://github.com/mtfoley/pr-compliance-action) that is meant to be used with pull requests instead of issues.

## üöÄ Usage

Create a workflow (eg: .github/workflows/issue-compliance.yml)

```yaml
name: Issue Compliance

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened]

# Action should have write permission to create comments, labels, etc.
permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  pr-compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: takanome-dev/issue-compliance-action@0.1.0
