This action is meant to help in managing issues. It will check for the following:

- [x] Issue has a title
  - [x] Title starts with a valid issue type (e.g. bug, feature, chore)
  - [x] Title does not contain some characters (e.g. <,>,#)
  - [x] Add a label `:no_entry: invalid title` if the title is invalid and remove it if it is valid
- [ ] Issue has a description
  - [ ] Description should include all required information based on the issue template
- [ ] What else?

This is a fork of [pr-compliance-action](https://github.com/mtfoley/pr-compliance-action) that is meant to be used with pull requests instead of issues.
